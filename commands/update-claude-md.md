   - Create it if it doesn't exist

2. **Gather session information**
   - Review the conversation history
   - Identify key actions, edits, and changes made
   - Note important decisions and configurations

3. **Document the following**
   - Commands executed
   - Files created or modified
   - Configuration changes
   - Problem-solving approaches used
   - Important learnings or patterns discovered
   - Any custom settings or preferences established

4. **Format the documentation**
   - Use clear markdown formatting
   - Organize by categories (e.g., "Files Modified", "Commands Run", "Configurations")
   - Include timestamps if relevant
   - Add code examples where appropriate

5. **Additional context to include**
   - Project-specific conventions discovered
